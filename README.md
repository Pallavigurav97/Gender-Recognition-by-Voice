# Gender-Recognition-By-Voice

## Introduction:
One of the most common means of communication in the world is through voice. In the real world, it is possible for a person to verify the gender of a person through voice. Gender recognition can be used along with various other applications. Some are:
1. For detecting feelings like male's sadness, female's anger, etc.
2. Differentiating audios and videos using tags.
3. Helping personal assistants to answer questions with gender-specific results etc.

## Objectives:
1. To check whether voice frequency is dependent on gender.
2. To build classifier and compare their performance.

## Statistical Tools:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Machine Learning Algorithms

## Conclusions:
1. The voice frequency of female is slightly greater than male.
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier are performing better on voice dataset.

## Scope For Future Study:
1. This type of study can be used in detecting the criminal's gender when voice is recorded but image cannot be seen.
2. This type of study can also useful for human to machine interaction, sorting of telephone calls by gender categorization, automatic solutions, muting sounds for gender, etc.
